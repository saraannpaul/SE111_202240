                <b>Sara Paul</b><i> August 11, 2022</i>
                <p>A review by me: <em>Dumb and Dumber</em> is one of my favorite movies of all time! I laugh through the entire movie. You feel entertained like there is not a dull moment. I am proud that the movie is made Rhode Island. The sequal Dumb and Dumber 2 is almost as funny ! it comes in at a close second! However, the prequel Dumb and Dumber(er) was a dissappoint! it did not reach the caliber of the other two!</p>

                    <h3>Trivia:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>“Dumb and Dumber” is a rather raunchy comedy, so naturally they turned it into a Saturday morning cartoon for children. It’s true! In 1995, Hanna-Barbera produced a “Dumb and Dumber” cartoon for ABC</li>
                        <li>Nicolas Cage And Gary Oldman Were The First Choices For Harry And Lloyd</li>
                        <li>One of Lloyd Christmas’ defining characteristics in the movie is his chipped tooth. This wasn’t achieved using movie magic; Jim Carrey actually has a chipped tooth that usually has a cap on it.</li>
